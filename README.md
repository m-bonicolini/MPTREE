It is a prototype of a multihoming proxy written with C language. The goal is to implement a multihoming protocol with TCP that act like sctp o Multipath-TCP. It was coded in 2008 as Computer Network exam and now it need an hard refactor. This repository may be a try to continue the project and to boost it as a net utility application for nix. 

The program run in Linux,NetBSD,FreeBSD,OpenBSD and MAC OS X. The project may be a starting idea for a research in the multihoming field.
